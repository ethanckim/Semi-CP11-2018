# Semi-CP11-2018
*Author: Ethan Calvin Kim*

These programs created are developed while enrolled in the Computer Programming 11 course instructed by Mr. Nathan Hapke, Semiahmoo Secondary School.

***For Current Students: Please do not copy this code directly for your projects. Mr.Hapke already assessed my work, and copying and pasting directly will immediately result in academic dishonesty.***

To run the programs, locate the .exe file in the bin/debug or bin/release directory.

The programs are organized into the following subdirectories and may include README.md files with specific instructions:
