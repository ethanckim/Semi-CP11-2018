# Blue Spheares 2D

Inspired by the original Sonic Blue Spheres game (1994), This game has the same objective as the original game: Collect ALL Blue spheres while avoiding Red Speres!

   Arrow Keys, and then press the Up Arrow Key to Begin Moving.

 * Guide Sonic using the Left/Right Arrow Keys and the Space Bar:

        * Right Arrow Key: rotate Sonic Clockwise

        * Left Arrow Key: rotate Sonic Counter Clockwise

 * **Blue Sphere**: Collect all of them to clear the stage! When the player
                          collects a blue sphere, it turns into a red sphere.
 
 * **Red Sphere**: The most common sphere which Sonic should avoid. 
                         Touching any red sphere will make you restart the stage.

 * **Rings**: Optional Collectives - Collect all of them to truly beat the level
             with a Perfect Rank!

 * **Bumpers**: When Sonic touch these spheres, he will be bounced
                    backwards, causing the controls to be Revesed.
